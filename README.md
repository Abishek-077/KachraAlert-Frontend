## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1) Prerequisites

- Node.js **18.18+** (Node 20 LTS recommended)
- npm (comes with Node)

### 2) Install dependencies

```bash
cd front-end
npm install
```

### 3) Configure environment variables

Create `front-end/.env.local`:

```env
# Backend API base URL (no trailing slash preferred)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Enable websocket-based alerts (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SOCKET=false
```

### 4) Run development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open: `http://localhost:3000`

---

## 📜 Available Scripts

Run these inside `front-end/`:

- `npm run dev` – start local dev server on port 3000
- `npm run build` – create production build
- `npm run start` – serve production build on port 3000
- `npm run lint` – run Next.js/ESLint checks

---

## 🔌 Backend Contract Notes

The frontend expects a backend that exposes endpoints under `/api/v1/*`, including:

- Auth: login, register, refresh, logout
- Alerts: list + mark read
- Reports, schedule, payments, messages, and admin user management endpoints

Authentication is handled using:

- Bearer access token for API calls
- Cookie-based persistence for remember-me sessions
- Automatic token refresh handling on `401` responses

---

## 👥 Role Model

Supported account types:

- `resident`
- `admin_driver`
- `admin`

UI role resolution maps `admin_driver` and `admin` into admin-capable dashboard navigation.

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Notes

- Responsive layout with persistent, collapsible sidebar in dashboard
- Theme support (light/dark)
- Designed for clean readability and quick action in operational workflows

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Blank/failed API calls:** verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and backend CORS settings.
- **Socket alerts not arriving:** ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SOCKET=true` and backend socket namespace/config is active.
- **Auth appears to reset:** check cookies in browser and confirm `/api/v1/auth/refresh` behavior.
